I'm a Salesforce Certified Technical Architect working in Accenture Japan. Over the years I've committed the clients' digital transformation for sectors like Financial Service, Retail, Utility, Telecommunication, Manufacturing, and so on. Expertise in general enterprise integration and customer service. I like two things the most, helping people and solving problems! I've learned a lot from you and trailblazer community, so I'm always looking for chances to giving back to the communityðŸ˜‰
