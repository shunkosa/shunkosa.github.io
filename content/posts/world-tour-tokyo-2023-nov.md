Salesforce World Tour Tokyo, one of the largest AI conferences in Japan, was held in late November. One of the best my personal memories was receiving a Golden Hoodie from Parker Harris after Koide-san, President of Salesforce Japan, introduced my community activities during the pre-show of main keynote.

I'd say I've done a lot of work in the Salesforce ecosystem over the years. Answering questions in Trailblazer Community, creating tools, publishing tips and best practices, speaking, organizing meetups and conferences, pro bono, and so on.

It's really fun to look for what is still missing in the Salesforce ecosystem, which still has great potential, to find room for my contribution, and to estimate how much of an impact I can make. And such extracurricular activities are directly related to our daily work. I have seen that many community activities had a positive impact on my company by improving my skills and giving back to the company. In other words, staying in your shell will lost opportunities!

But big achievements take time. My volunteer in Salesforce.org community started with a small conversation in [India in 2018](../my-indiadreamin18-highlights) and now it has become a big project with over 10 people involved. Be humble and keep doing small outputs. The longer you keep at it, the stronger your connections will become and the more you will be able to challenge yourself to do things that you could not do alone.

When thinking about your career, there is a framework that considers three key words: Will/Can/Must (Should). "Will" is what you want to do, "Can" is what you can, and "Must (Should)" is what others expect you to do. It's important to get them right. Have you set up your "Will" to match your "Can"?  Are your actions in line with your "Must (Should)"? These elements will become clearer and bigger as you go outside of your shell. As you expand your own world, larger dream you have, more things you can, and more will be expected of you. Only you will be the point of contact with your outside world. And there it's also important to talk about your own experiences in your own words than to stick to theory. Others often get inspiration and insight from your experiences. 

Many actions remain on my bucket list. What others have not yet done and what I want to do. The dilemma is that I cannot find enough time for community activities to prioritize family time and daily work, but the fact that I still have a long way to go inspires me.

I believe everyone has desire to contribute to something. Take good care of that! Start today with the "outside of your shell" things you can do. It's the first step to your big "Will" and "Can".

I'd like to thank everyone involved in this event and everyone I connected with at this event.
