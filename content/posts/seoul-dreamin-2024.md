I had the opportunity to visit South Korea once [again](../trailblazers-in-korea). This time, I had the honor of speaking at Seoul Dreamin', the first-ever Salesforce community conference in South Korea. The opportunity arose a few months ago when Obidjon, one of the organizers, came to Japan to attend the World Tour Tokyo. I was thrilled to connect him with Japanese community leaders, and after hearing from him about the conference, I felt it would be a great opportunity.

I shared an overview of Salesforce Well-Architected along with some of my related project experiences. Although I haven't received official feedback on the session yet, I hope it was good to did an interactive session using mentimeter.

Seoul Dreamin' had over 200 participants and featured six sessions along with a DemoJam, all held on a weekday afternoon. The DemoJam was outstanding. I was impressed by both the well-made packages they created and their presentation skills. It was impossible to choose a winner. The other sessions were also excellent. I did my best to follow the presentations using Google Lens.

One of the reasons I love Dreamin' events, as I experienced in [India](../my-indiadreamin18-highlights), is the cultural exchange and the close-knit atmosphere. In contrast, Dreamforce can sometimes feel too large and busy to have relaxed conversations with others.

I was pleasantly surprised by the understanding of Japanese culture and language among the people in South Korea, as well as by their hospitality. There were many cultural differences that caught me off guard and even made me laugh, such as various regulations (e.g., location of AP instances), business customs, popular actors, and the differences in dating styles between Koreans and Japanese, and so on.

Now, seems like it’s my turn to give back. I've started taking Korean courses on Duolingo and have been able to keep it up for a week. I hope that by next year, I'll be able to exchange greetings and have simple conversations. Additionally, plans are underway to collaborate online with the Korean community. The dream doesn’t end here!
