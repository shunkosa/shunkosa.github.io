One of the best my personal memories was receiving a Golden Hoodie from Parker Harris after Koide-san, President of Salesforce Japan, introduced my community activities during the pre-show of main keynote.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="../img/swtt2023nov_01.jpg" width="50%"/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;h4>Me panicking because the interview sequence was not what I expected. I&amp;#39;m really bad at improvising! My head was outputting 500 Internal Server Error like a bad program. There was no rehearsal. I was left with a little regret that I should have spoken better...&lt;/h4>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d say I&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot of work in the Salesforce ecosystem over the years. Answering questions in Trailblazer Community, creating tools, publishing tips and best practices, speaking, organizing meetups and conferences, pro bono, and so on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s really fun to look for what is still missing in the Salesforce ecosystem, which still has great potential, to find room for my contribution, and to estimate how much of an impact I can make. And such extracurricular activities are directly related to our daily work. I have seen that many community activities had a positive impact on my company by improving my skills and giving back to the company. In other words, staying in your shell will lost opportunities!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But big achievements take time. My volunteer in Salesforce.org community started with a small conversation in &lt;a href="../my-indiadreamin18-highlights">India in 2018&lt;/a> and now it has become a big project with over 10 people involved. Be humble and keep doing small outputs. The longer you keep at it, the stronger your connections will become and the more you will be able to challenge yourself to do things that you could not do alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When thinking about your career, there is a framework that considers three key words: Will/Can/Must (Should). &amp;ldquo;Will&amp;rdquo; is what you want to do, &amp;ldquo;Can&amp;rdquo; is what you can, and &amp;ldquo;Must (Should)&amp;rdquo; is what others expect you to do. It&amp;rsquo;s important to get them right. Have you set up your &amp;ldquo;Will&amp;rdquo; to match your &amp;ldquo;Can&amp;rdquo;? Are your actions in line with your &amp;ldquo;Must (Should)&amp;rdquo;? These elements will become clearer and bigger as you go outside of your shell. As you expand your own world, larger dream you have, more things you can, and more will be expected of you. Only you will be the point of contact with your outside world. And there it&amp;rsquo;s also important to talk about your own experiences in your own words than to stick to theory. Others often get inspiration and insight from your experiences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many actions and plans remain on my bucket list. What others have not yet done and what I want to do with you. The dilemma is that I cannot find enough time for community activities to prioritize my family time and daily work, but the fact that I still have a long way to go inspires me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I believe everyone has desire to contribute to something. Take good care of that! Start today with the &amp;ldquo;outside of your shell&amp;rdquo; things you can do. It&amp;rsquo;s the first step to your big &amp;ldquo;Will&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Can&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d like to thank everyone involved in this event and everyone I connected with at this event.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lightning Tab Icons</title><link>https://shunkosa.github.io/posts/lightning-tab-icons/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jul 2023 00:49:35 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://shunkosa.github.io/posts/lightning-tab-icons/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://ideas.salesforce.com/s/idea/a0B8W00000PlLy5UAF/unified-design-for-salesforce-setup-enhancing-usability-and-accessibility">Requests for improvements to Setup screen&lt;/a> are hot topic for all roles. I expressed the similar opinion in the True to the Core session at last year&amp;rsquo;s World Tour Tokyo. I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to future updates. But what about existing features?&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="../img/tabsetup.png" width="60%"/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;h4>Why oh why&lt;/h4>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>You still see classic tab icons in tab setup page in Lightning Experience. It may just be an icon, but the problem is the fact that the UX is not integrated, and that is one of its clearest evidences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a first aid measure, I just created a page with each icon side by side.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/shunkosa/salesforce-tab-icons/">https://github.com/shunkosa/salesforce-tab-icons/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="../img/tabicons.png" width="60%"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>It was easy. Scraping through the tab&amp;rsquo;s settings page, you can see the Classic icons and their names. There are icons with the same name in the Lightning Design System. I wonder why this does not show the actual setting page, but bookmark this if you like!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wishing you a pleasant experience with your tab settings and application settings.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Document Your Process Builder</title><link>https://shunkosa.github.io/posts/document-your-process-builder/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Mar 2020 00:49:35 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://shunkosa.github.io/posts/document-your-process-builder/</guid><description>&lt;p>We often create various documents for deliverables, review, taking over, just an explanation to teammates, and so on. If the document is based on your Salesforce environment, you may create it automatically from the org to avoid maintaining both.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, the followings are popular tools to export Salesforce settings including object fields definition.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/salesforce-devtools/ehgmhinnhggigkogkbhnbodhbfjgncjf">Salesforce DevTools&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://github.com/nyasba/docforce2">docforce2&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>And some companies may have their own tools internally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, how about Lightning Flow? &lt;a href="https://success.salesforce.com/ideaView?id=08730000000DmiPAAS">This idea&lt;/a> has more than 3k points but the metadata of lightning flow is complex and I cannot find any open source tools that supports it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not found? Just make it! As a prototype, I created the following tools to document process builder setting.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://github.com/shunkosa/sfdx-flowdoc-plugin/raw/master/img/screenshot.png" width="100%"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://flowdoc.herokuapp.com">Flowdoc Web App&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.github.com/shunkosa/sfdx-flowdoc-plugin">Flowdoc Salesforce CLI Extension&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="web-app">Web App&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Connect your org and click the download icon of the flow you want to export. PDF file will open in another browser tab. Currently this tool supports trigger-based process builder only. (And unfortunately it still doesn&amp;rsquo;t support all the process builder settings.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../img/flowdoc_screenshot.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cli-extension">CLI Extension&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Install the plugin&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>sfdx plugins:install sfdx-flowdoc-plugin
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>and then run,&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>sfdx flowdoc:pdf:generate YOUR_PROCESS_API_NAME
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;h2 id="behind-the-scenes">Behind the Scenes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This tool simply parses &lt;a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_meta.meta/api_meta/meta_visual_workflow.htm">Flow metadata&lt;/a> and construct a object to generate pdf by &lt;a href="http://pdfmake.org/#/">pdfmake&lt;/a>. For example, a criteria element in process builder is represented as &lt;code>&amp;lt;decisions&amp;gt;&lt;/code> element in medatada.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../img/process_metadata_example.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/shunkosa/a07faf8ebf0012c2b4c92fbf79817e1f.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>You can see &lt;code>&amp;lt;connector&amp;gt;&lt;/code> element and it refers to a next element like action or next criteria. Tracking this recursively, you can retrieve a sequence of action group elements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But &lt;code>&amp;lt;decisions&amp;gt;&lt;/code> represents not only criteria in process, but also evaluation of scheduled action, and of course decision in flow builder. Now I write code only for displaying process builder settings, so further studies on flow metadata are needed to make this more abstract.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="next-step">Next Step&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m working on the rest of process builder settings and flow builder settings. Your feedback is always welcomed!&lt;/p>

Some trailblazer community groups there have just started and I felt like I should help with the diamond in the rough and grow up together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;figure>&lt;img src="../img/20190828_1.jpg" width="50%"/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;h4>Lunch with traiblazers in Korea&lt;/h4>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="../img/20190828_2.jpg" width="50%"/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;h4>At the Partner Summit&lt;/h4>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And this month, customer case presentation competition was held in Seoul. Such events to show the success story are popular in Salesforce ecosystem, like Partner Innovation Award in Dreamforce, and the same event in Japan. On the previous trip, we could share hint/tips on community activities because we had the same worries. I think it can also apply to customer use cases. Users often have the same troubles. Scattered spreadsheets, data quality, integration, and so on. I visited Korea again to learn their practical use and get inspiration!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>7 trailblazers shared their success stories. They use various products and have resolved various issues. After finished, I noticed that my note had over 300 lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I reaffirmed that Salesforce was not a panacea though it&amp;rsquo;s a great product. We need to face to face with the business and technical issues in sincerity, and keep the conversations going with stakeholders, users, and customers, no matter what role you&amp;rsquo;re in. The speakers have been doing so. Through the event, I saw their tenacious and steady efforts, which are not much covered in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbzt2e0fTMo&amp;amp;list=PL_zETKbWKRwSrb29Cb8eda-Dh3m9kLbCq">the beautiful official videos&lt;/a>. That&amp;rsquo;s why I empathize with their stories.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was so hard for me to vote. Imagine you are in a luxury restaurant and all of the menus are your favorite. Essentially we cannot compare the stories. But from the view of an attendee who was also engaged in the competition in Japan, I found their stories were no less wonderful than those in Japan.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">All done with happy. Thank you for share your story and your voice to us. I am so lucky I was able to be with you guys. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/salesforce?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@salesforce&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sarahahn20?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@sarahahn20&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/akikobannai?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@akikobannai&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/xIyCeaxQ8G">pic.twitter.com/xIyCeaxQ8G&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; David Sanghyeon Hong (@to_gomsk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/to_gomsk/status/1166706386668941312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 28, 2019&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>Huge congratulations, Sarah and Ruby! And thank you so much ALL of the speakers for taking your time and sharing your stories. I can imagine how hard to prepare and how nervous you felt before the presentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to meet passionate trailblazers and have reasonable and delicious local foods, I strongly recommend that you visit Korea. My next plan is to visit Salesforce Saturday Seoul.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See you soon!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Salesforce Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions</title><link>https://shunkosa.github.io/posts/salesforce-continuous-integration-with-github-actions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Aug 2019 22:12:46 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://shunkosa.github.io/posts/salesforce-continuous-integration-with-github-actions/</guid><description>&lt;p>After 6 months in the wait list, &lt;a href="https://github.com/features/actions">GitHub Actions&lt;/a> (v2) finally came to my account. It&amp;rsquo;s a built-in CI/CD service for GitHub. I quickly tested it and I found it pretty good tool for GitHub users to start CI easily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../img/20190825_1.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll show a simple example to realize continuous integration for Salesforce development. When a pull request is created, the following tasks will be automatically executed.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Create a scratch org&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Push source&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run Apex tests&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Comment the org login url to the thread. (NOTICE: Don&amp;rsquo;t do this in public repos)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="initial-setup">Initial setup&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Create a connected app and a private key for JWT flow. Follow the steps in the &lt;a href="https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/sfdx_travis_ci/sfdx_travis_ci_connected_app">Trailhead project&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="save-secrets">Save secrets&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Store the consumer key of connected app as &lt;code>SALESFORCE_CONSUMER_KEY&lt;/code> to repository secret. I also store secret key directly as &lt;code>SALESFORCE_JWT_SECRET_KEY&lt;/code>. Or, you can store the decryption key and IV for encrypted secret key in the repository. And store the username of DevHub as &lt;code>SALESFORCE_DEVHUB_USERNAME&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../img/20190825_2.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="define-workflow">Define workflow&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Define workflow in &lt;code>.github/workflows/main.yaml&lt;/code>. For more information about workflow syntax, see &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions">Workflow Syntax for GitHub Actions&lt;/a>
&lt;script type="application/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/shunkosa/905d131a96d9c8619ae039529c040b20.js">&lt;/script>
&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="highlights">Highlights&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A workflow is made up of one ore more jobs. A job contains a sequence of tasks called steps. Jobs run in parallel by default and each job runs in a fresh instance. In the above workflow, for simplicity, single job named &lt;code>build&lt;/code> runs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(line 9) : &lt;code>checkout@master&lt;/code> runs &lt;code>git fetch&lt;/code> and &lt;code>git checkout $GITHUB_SHA&lt;/code>, so this action always checkouts the commit of the event trigger.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(line 24) : The repository secrets are available in workflow by &lt;code>${{ secrets.YOUR_SECRET_NAME }}&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(line 39) : GitHub API is used to comment to the pull request. You can use default &lt;code>GITHUB_TOKEN&lt;/code> secret as access token. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to generate a new token for CI/CD service!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(line 40) : &lt;code>github&lt;/code> default context is used to specify the pull request URL. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows">Events that trigger workflows&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="see-how-it-works">See how it works&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../img/20190825_3.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now you can easily and effectively review the pull request using the scratch org automatically created and tested.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next step is to delete the scratch org after the pull request is merged/closed. We need to store the org username somehow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like GitHub Actions from many views. Tightly-coupled with the repository (infinite possibilities to integrate with the repository!). Concurrency. Supporting multiple OS. Various 3rd party actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope more and more Salesforce developers try GitHub Actions. Share if you create an awesome action!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My #IndiaDreamin18 Highlights</title><link>https://shunkosa.github.io/posts/my-indiadreamin18-highlights/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Dec 2018 19:30:59 +0900</pubDate><guid>https://shunkosa.github.io/posts/my-indiadreamin18-highlights/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to visit India because actually I really like Indian dishes and I&amp;rsquo;m interested in the culture and people in this rapidly-growing country. After I chatted with my friends Amy and Paarth in twitter and talked with India Dreamin&amp;rsquo; organizer Vinay at MVP party in DF18, I made up my mind. This was the first time for me to attend overseas community driven event.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://indiadreamin.in">India Dreamin&amp;rsquo;&lt;/a> is one of the largest community driven event globally. About 1,800 trailblazers attended. The venue is the organizer&amp;rsquo;s alma mater, G.L. Bajaj, Noida.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;figure>&lt;img src="../img/20181201_1.jpg" width="50%"/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;h4>Lively Expo!&lt;/h4>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="../img/20181201_2.jpg" width="50%"/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;h4>Biggest Hall in the venue, Ganga Hall&lt;/h4>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I attended a lot of amazing keynotes and sessions. I&amp;rsquo;d prefer technical session but I was paying attention to &amp;ldquo;story&amp;rdquo;, too. For example, developer keynote by René was no code and no demo but it definitely motivating for developers not to be left behind the times.

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my session, I talked how wonderful Japan trailblazer community is, and how I&amp;rsquo;ve learned and grown up with them. Honestly I wondered if I should talk about my career. I&amp;rsquo;m not confident with talking about myself. I think this is because I&amp;rsquo;m always overwhelmed by trailblazers around me. But I gradually came to feel I wanted to share my thoughts about community after I took an inventory of part of my life which is effected by trailblazer community in Japan. Overall it wasn&amp;rsquo;t good talk so much, but I think it was a kind of cultural communication. Tell me more about community groups you&amp;rsquo;re engaged in!
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">The passion for Community shown during &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shunkosa?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@shunkosa&lt;/a> Session “How Japan &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Trailblazer?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Trailblazer&lt;/a> Community Changed My Career” had us all Smiling🤗🤗🤗 &lt;br>Great Job my friend🙌🏽❤️🙌🏽 “Someone who gives everything, will get true everything at the end.” 🇯🇵 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tokyo?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Tokyo&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SalesforceSaturday?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SalesforceSaturday&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MenWhoLead?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MenWhoLead&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/g52tmhxNVg">pic.twitter.com/g52tmhxNVg&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Stephanie Herrera (@steph_herrera_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/steph_herrera_/status/1068937612709134338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2018&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what is the difference between community driven event and official event like DF? I think one is the closeness of others. You can enjoy a lot of cultural differences. Different career journeys. Incredible car traffic in India and crazy rush hour in Japan trains. And the true meaning of &amp;ldquo;user group&amp;rdquo;. In Japan, it means business user&amp;quot; group, so I first thought user group doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain developer group!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I met a lot of amazing people here. I can&amp;rsquo;t thank you enough for everyone. Organizer Shivanath and Vinay. All the sponsors. All the speakers. My Accenture friend Seema. All the trailblazers in India. I enjoyed every minute I spent with you.

&lt;p>Lightning component action is a handy option to create custom function called from record detail page. We can launch a lightning component from a custom action by just implementing either &lt;code>force:lightningQuickAction&lt;/code> or &lt;code>force:lightningQuickActionWithoutHeader&lt;/code>. However, lightning component action has serious user interface problems. I will introduce them and propose a workaround.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="problems">Problems&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A component implemented force:lightningQuickAction is shown on the auto-created modal and its header and footer are outside of the component. So we can neither customize the header text nor put an another button next to the cancel button on the footer.
&lt;img src="../img/20171212181307.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a natural to think about recreating everything in a component implemented force:lightningQuickActionWithoutHeader. However, it has another problem. Extra margin is generated.
&lt;img src="../img/20171212181318.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="workaround">Workaround&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Notice: The following workaround is not compatible with Salesforce mobile and not available for API version 42.0 or later.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can overwrite the style of the auto-created modal by inline CSS to disable extra margin. Another possibility is calling a custom modal from lightning:button tag but it requires you to recreate a highlight panel and it would be a tough work.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>.cuf-content{
padding:0 !important;
}
.slds-p-around--medium{
padding:0 !important;
}
.slds-modal__content{
overflow-y:hidden !important;
height:unset !important;
max-height:unset !important;
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>&lt;img src="../img/20171212181336.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we get a modal which is similar to standard action.

&lt;h2 id="reusable-component">Reusable component&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I created a template modal component which can be used in a component implemented force:lightningQuickActionWithoutHeader. It is available on &lt;a href="https://github.com/shunkosa/lightningaction-modal">this repository&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="usage">Usage&lt;/h2>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>&amp;lt;aura:component implements=&amp;#34;force:lightningQuickActionWithoutHeader&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;c:LightningActionModal title=&amp;#34;Hello world!&amp;#34; percentWidth=&amp;#34;85&amp;#34; bodyHeight=&amp;#34;300&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
//awesome modal body
&amp;lt;aura:set attribute=&amp;#34;footer&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;lightning:button label=&amp;#34;Cancel&amp;#34; variant=&amp;#34;neutral&amp;#34;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;lightning:button label=&amp;#34;Save&amp;#34; variant=&amp;#34;brand&amp;#34; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/aura:set&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/c:LightningActionModal&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/aura:component&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;h2 id="appendix">Appendix&lt;/h2>
